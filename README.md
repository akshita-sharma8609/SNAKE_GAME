# SNAKE_GAME

This is the basic Snake Game built using pygame library of python. I am pretty sure that all of us had played this game before, atleast once in our life.
The snake can eat food, grow longer, collide with boundaries and collide with itself. Implements background sound and game over sound using pygame.mixer(). Also displays a score, a game over message and a new high score generated message if you beat the existing high score.


# Prerequisites

There must be python installed on your system. I am using python3.
Also you need to setup pygame and mixer modules of python. 

# HOW TO RUN IT ON YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM?

1. Download the entire folder from the repository.
2. Run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
3. Press Enter to play.
4. Start playing with the arrow keys.
